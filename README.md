8-1 Journal: Reflection
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
- For this course, we were tasked to explore different means of storing information retrieved from a set of data.
- More specifically we were given a list of courses in a comma separated excel spreadsheet.
- Some courses had prerequisites, but the primary focus was figuring out how to efficiently store this information into an efficient system for searching, removing or adding new information to the data set.
- The methods explored were vectors, hash tables and biinary search trees.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
- I chose to approach this assiognment under the impression that new courses could be added in the future and I felt the most efficient way to do this would be to use a hash table to sort the information.
  
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
- I solved this by primarily stepping back and understanding how I wanted to approach the solution to a problem.
- There wer also some sources from google when I approached something I didn't know.
- A couple of websites I found reliable were stack overflow and GeeksforGeeks.
  
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
- It taught me how to be more efficient with my programming.
- A aspect of programming that was talked abut but not taught in depth until now was how to make code efficiently perform its task.
- I feel this course and its work helped specify that process.
  
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- I now know that with each line of code implemented there is a certain amount of time that the comupter can take to process that information.
- By limiting code that takes up valuable resources, the program becomes extremely efficient, plain and simple.
- In the end, no one wants a program that'll bog down their computer unless it's intended to do so.
